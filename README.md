# A integrated glance of full Flask usage

Flask is micro web framework written in Python, with no database abstraction layer or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions, meanwhile Flask supports large range of extentions which can make Flask serves as full functional framework.

The core functions of Flask itself is providing request-response handling and webpage rendering. These two functions are achieved by Werkzeug (a toolkit for Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) applications) and Jinja (a template engine, similar to the Django web framework) respectively.
